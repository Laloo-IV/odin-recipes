    <p>Ready to make this mochi muffin recipe? Here’s what you’ll need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Sweet rice flour: These mochi muffins start with glutinous or sweet rice
        flour (such as Mochiko).
      </li>
      <li>
        Sugars: A blend of brown and white sugars gives the perfect amount of
        sweetness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps
        the muffins rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but
        it won’t make the muffins taste salty.
      </li>
      <li>Coconut milk: You’ll need a can of unsweetened coconut milk.</li>
      <li>
        Eggs: Two whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the muffin batter
        together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Butter: A half a stick of melted butter adds even more moisture and
        flavor.
      </li>
      <li>Vanilla: A dash of vanilla extract creates a deeper flavor.</li>
      <li>
        Maple syrup: Add more sweetness and warm flavor with two tablespoons of
        maple syrup.
      </li>
      <li>Sesame seeds: Sesame seeds take the flavor up a notch.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>
        <strong>Step 2.</strong> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees

        vanilla, and maple syrup in a large bowl. Add flour mixture to coconut
        milk mixture and stir just until combined.

        <strong>Step 5.</strong> Divide batter between prepared muffin cups,
        filling nearly full. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 6.</strong> Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick
        inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool in pan on
        a wire rack 10 minutes. Remove from pan and serve warm or cool
        completely.
